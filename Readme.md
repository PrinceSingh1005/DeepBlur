# DeepBlur – GAN-based Face De-Identification System

## 📌 Overview
DeepBlur is a **deep learning-based face de-identification system** designed to anonymize facial identities while preserving visual realism. With the growing adoption of AI-driven facial recognition, privacy concerns are critical. DeepBlur leverages **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**, particularly **StyleGAN2, StyleGAN3, BigGAN, and VQ-VAE-2**, along with **GAN inversion techniques (e4e, L-BFGS optimization)** to generate anonymized yet realistic face images.

This project was developed as part of **CS64123 – Deep Learning Project** at **NIT Patna**.

---

## 🚀 Features
- 🔒 **Privacy Protection:** Obfuscates identities while retaining natural facial attributes (pose, lighting, expression).
- 🖼️ **High-Quality Outputs:** Preserves realism using **hybrid loss functions** (MSE + LPIPS + SSIM).
- ⚡ **Multi-Model Comparison:** Benchmarked across StyleGAN2, StyleGAN3, BigGAN, and VQ-VAE-2.
- 📊 **Quantitative Evaluation:** Uses MSE, PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS for measuring reconstruction and de-identification.
- 🌐 **Applications:** Healthcare, surveillance, smart cities, social media privacy, and content moderation.

---

## 📂 Dataset
- **FFHQ Dataset (Flickr-Faces-HQ)** – pre-trained StyleGAN2 and StyleGAN3 models trained on high-resolution human faces.
- Test images manually added for obfuscation through the DeepBlur pipeline.

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture
The DeepBlur pipeline consists of:
1. **Image Preprocessing:** Resize and normalize input images (1024×1024 for StyleGAN, 256×256 for BigGAN).
2. **Latent Space Mapping (Inversion):**  
   - Encoder-based inversion (e4e)  
   - Gradient-based optimization (L-BFGS)
3. **Face Generation:** Reconstruct identity-free faces via GANs.
4. **Evaluation:** Metrics include MSE, SSIM, PSNR, and LPIPS.

## 📊 Results

| Model     | MSE    | PSNR (dB) | SSIM   | LPIPS  |
| --------- | ------ | --------- | ------ | ------ |
| StyleGAN3 | 0.0123 | 22.87     | 0.8123 | 0.1289 |
| StyleGAN2 | 0.0134 | 22.49     | 0.8012 | 0.1350 |
| BigGAN    | 0.0257 | 19.32     | 0.6550 | 0.2561 |
| VQ-VAE-2  | 0.0231 | 19.78     | 0.6783 | 0.2112 |

* Hybrid losses (MSE + LPIPS) significantly improved perceptual similarity.
* StyleGAN3 outperformed other models in terms of quality and privacy balance.
